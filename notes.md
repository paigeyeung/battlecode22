Team A is red, Team B is blue

Ideas

- Rush enemy Archons for the win
    - Sacrifice Archon to rush
- Fortify and play defense
    - If I have more Archons than enemy, transition to defensive
- Scouting enemy strategy
- Cannon rush
    - Builder builds watchtowers around enemy base
    - Builder builds watchtowers in unoccupied location and watchtowers move to enemy base
- Play defensive on long maps and rush on short maps
- Gather data of tournament map?
- Each my unit toggles a bit every turn it's alive, stopped toggling means it's dead?
- Remove seeded randomness?

    - w4
        - If there are hostile enemies in vision range, stop producing miners
            - If can build soldier, build solder
            - Otherwise, if there is a damaged soldier, repair it
        - Try to build in direction of enemy
    - w5
        - Build miner / builder / soldier in 30% / 10% / 60%

    - future
        - Determine number of miners needed based on feedback
- Miner
    - example
        - Try to mine gold and lead if there’s any around us
        - Otherwise, move in a random direction
    - w1
        - Slight adjustment to always mine gold before mining lead
    - future
        - Try mine gold, then try move towards gold, then try mine lead, then try move towards lead
- Builder
    - w5
        - Try to repair prototype building
        - Try to repair damaged building
        - Try to build watchtower every 200 turns
        - Move randomly
- Soldier
    - example
        - Try to attack enemy if there’s any around us
        - Otherwise, move in a random direction
    - w1
        - If no enemy is nearby, move towards enemy Archon
        - If enemy is nearby, move towards ally Archon
        - If path is blocked, move randomly
    - w2
        - Pick nearest Archons to move towards
    - w3
        - If hostile enemy is nearby, move towards my Archon
        - If peaceful enemy is nearby, move towards enemy
    - w6
        - Smart selection of attack target
    - w7
        - Locally evaluate combat for decision making
    - future
        - Use shared array for combat decision making
- Sage
- Laboratory
- Watchtower
    - w5
        - Try to attack enemy
- Any unit
    - example
        - Track turn count in static variable
    - w1
        - Track starting location in static variable
    - w2
        - Read Archon locations from shared array
        - Droids help update Archons seen and alive in shared array
    - w6
        - Track starting Archon in static variable
    - w8
        - Refactor into classes
    - future
        - Search for enemy Archons in radius if it is missing
        - First Archon to run is resource manager for the turn
        - Locally evaluate combat score to determine attack/retreat
- Shared array
    - w2
        - Indicies 0-3 store ally Archon locations, 4-7 store enemy Archon locations
            - Max map width and height are 60
            - 0 to 64 can be stored in 6 bits
            - Each 16 bit int stores x location in first 6 bits and y location in second 6 bits
            - Second to last bit is whether unit is alive or not
            - Last bit is whether unit has been seen at least once
            - x | x | x | x | x | x | y | y | y | y | y | y | alive | seen
    - w9
        - Indicies 0-3 store ally Archon locations
            - Last bit is toggled by ally Archon every turn to show it's alive
            - x | x | x | x | x | x | y | y | y | y | y | y | alive | toggle
    - future
        - Index 8 stores combat scores
            - First 6 bits is ally highest combat score
            - Second 6 bits is enemy highest combat score
            - Last 4 bits are last turn's combat decision 

Paige's Notes
- pathfinding
    - long distance general purpose pathfinding algorithm
    - individual short distance algorithms for each unit
         - miners
             - highest priority is to avoid enemy hostile units
             - mine gold if possible
             - move towards gold if possible and visible
             - mine lead if possible
             - move towards lead if possible and visible
             - search unexplored areas for lead
         - soldiers + sages
             - later
